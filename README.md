Project was made for educational purposes only.

Has some commands, I don't even know which ones tbh.

Alot of this is broken and I wont be fixing it as many  people have wanted me to use this for harm.

Isn't very good and shouldn't be used by anyone.
Do not use this maliciously as there are many reprocussions for cybercrime.

Also the AntiDump is pasted from somewhere

# Setup Guide:

*Remember to not use this for malicious purposes.*

Load this into IntelliJ

and then build it? What did you think I was gonna say?

Or use command prompt....
